# Implementation Report

Date: 2026-04-20
Project: Programming for AI - Review Sentiment/Star Prediction API

## 1. What We Were Asked To Do

The work evolved in phases:

1. Create a CV-friendly summary of the project.
2. Explain the complete workflow and identify room for innovation.
3. Add human-in-the-loop (HITL) review support and drift detection.
4. Use Firebase Firestore as the persistence layer.
5. Make credential setup easier by auto-picking local credentials where possible.
6. Protect credential files and runtime noise with .gitignore updates.
7. Add automated tests for all new behavior.
8. Fix test errors in the Firestore API test file.
9. Finish remaining todo items and validate results.

## 2. High-Level Outcome

The API moved from inference-only behavior to a more production-ready MLOps flow:

- Prediction persistence in Firestore.
- Automatic queueing of uncertain cases for human review.
- Human label submission endpoint to close the feedback loop.
- Drift detection pipeline with persisted metrics.
- Better service health visibility (including Firestore status).
- Expanded automated tests (unit, endpoint-level, HTTP integration, emulator e2e).
- CI workflow for regression protection.

## 3. Architecture Changes

## 3.1 Before

- FastAPI service accepted review input and returned prediction.
- No persistent store for inference logs.
- No structured HITL queue.
- No drift metrics or drift endpoint.

## 3.2 After

End-to-end flow now supports:

1. Client calls POST /predict.
2. Inference runs through existing model-routing logic.
3. Inference metadata is persisted to Firestore.
4. Case is optionally queued for human review based on policy rules.
5. Reviewer fetches queue and submits human label.
6. Label is persisted and linked back to inference.
7. Drift job computes metrics from historical vs current windows.
8. Drift metrics are stored and served by API.

## 4. File-by-File Change Log

## 4.1 API Core

### api/main.py

Main integration point for Firestore and new operational endpoints.

Key updates:

- Added Firestore lifecycle state:
  - FIRESTORE_STATE with client, connected, error.
- During startup (lifespan):
  - Attempts Firestore connection using service helper.
  - Stores connection status and error details.
- During shutdown:
  - Clears model and Firestore state safely.
- Health endpoint:
  - Added firestore_connected field in response.
  - Reports Firestore issue details when models are loaded but Firestore is unavailable.
- Added _require_firestore_client helper:
  - Standardized 503 response when Firestore is unavailable.
- Predict endpoint enhancements:
  - Captures latency via perf_counter.
  - Keeps inference functional even if Firestore persistence fails.
  - Persists inference metadata and potential review queue outcome.
  - Returns additional response fields:
    - inference_id
    - queued_for_review
    - review_reasons
- New endpoints:
  - GET /human-review/queue
  - POST /human-review/{queue_id}/label
  - POST /drift/run

- Uses isolated per-test collection names.
- Verifies log -> queue -> label roundtrip.
- Verifies drift insufficient-data behavior.

## 4.5 CI

New CI workflow:

- Triggers on push to main, pull_request, and manual dispatch.
- Uses Python 3.12.
- Installs requirements + pytest/httpx.
- Runs targeted core and new test files.

## 7. Issues Encountered and How They Were Resolved

1. PowerShell env var syntax issue:

- Fix: documented and used $env:VAR="value".

2. Invalid browser URL with 0.0.0.0:
- Problem: browser cannot use 0.0.0.0 destination.
- Fix: documented localhost/127.0.0.1 usage.

3. Interpreter mismatch (global python vs venv):
- Problem: some starts used wrong interpreter context.
- Fix: documented explicit venv command for uvicorn.

4. Port binding conflict (8000 already in use):
- Problem: startup failures with WinError 10048.
- Fix: identified listener and cleared process before relaunch.

5. Test compile errors in Firestore API tests:
- Problem: schema-required fields missing in test payload.
- Fix: adjusted payloads and revalidated diagnostics/tests.

## 8. Validation and Test Results

Recent targeted suite execution completed successfully:

- Command run:
  - .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_schemas.py tests/test_engine.py tests/test_firestore_service.py tests/test_api_firestore_features.py tests/test_api_testclient_integration.py tests/test_firestore_emulator_e2e.py -q
- Result:
  - 90 passed
  - 2 skipped (expected emulator-gated tests when emulator is not enabled)

## 9. Completed Work Summary

Completed and verified:

- Firestore integration in API lifecycle and predict flow.
- HITL queue + label submission API.
- Drift detection run + retrieval API.
- Extended schemas and response contracts.

## 10. Suggested Next Improvements

1. Add scripts for stable local operations on Windows:
   - scripts/start_api.ps1
   - scripts/run_tests.ps1
   - scripts/run_firestore_emulator_tests.ps1

2. Add a dedicated CI job for emulator tests:
   - Run only when emulator service is provided.

3. Add a lightweight dashboard for:
   - queue depth
   - reviewer throughput
   - drift trends over time

4. Add alerting for drift status transitions:
   - warn/alert notifications via email or chat webhook.

5. Add active-learning loop:
   - periodic retraining using high-confidence human-labeled data.

## 11. CV-Ready Impact Statement (Optional)

Designed and implemented a production-style MLOps extension for a FastAPI NLP inference service by integrating Firebase Firestore for inference logging, human-in-the-loop review workflows, and automated drift detection (PSI/JSD/quality-rate metrics), then hardened delivery with multi-layer automated testing and CI.
